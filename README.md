# ðŸ§  Flowchart Shape Detection using YOLOv8 + Roboflow

This repository contains a trained YOLOv8 object detection model fine-tuned using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) to detect and classify various flowchart components such as processes, decisions, input/output blocks, and connectors.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This model is designed to:
- Detect hand-drawn or digital flowchart components.
- Enable automated flowchart digitization and editing.
- Integrate with tools like React Flow or diagram editors.

## ðŸ§¾ Model Performance

| Metric              | Value |
|---------------------|-------|
| mAP@0.50            | 0.957 |
| mAP@0.50:0.95       | 0.846 |
| Precision           | 0.980 |
| Recall              | 0.933 |

These results indicate high reliability in object localization and classification across a diverse dataset of ~29,000 images.

## ðŸ§  Classes Detected

- **Process Box**
- **Decision (Diamond)**
- **Start/End**
- **Connector/Arrow**
